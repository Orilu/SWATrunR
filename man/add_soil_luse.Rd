}
\arguments{
\item{cond}{Character string that defines condition for the variable \code{var}.}

\item{var}{Variable to which the condition is applied}

\item{conds_all}{List of possible values for condition variables ('hsg',
'texture', 'plant', 'landuse').}

the condition is applied. the column \code{CHG_TYPE} which gives the Boolean

do not really well represent the columns' meaning but are required for
binding to the rows of calibration.cal.

into a tibble which can be added to the calibration.cal initialization for
